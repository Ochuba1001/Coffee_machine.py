# ☕ Python Coffee Machine Program

A terminal-based simulation of a coffee vending machine built with Python. This project mimics the workflow of a real coffee machine — from drink selection to payment handling and resource tracking.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Menu**: Choose from Latte, Espresso, Cappuccino, or Chocolate.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Each drink has a set cost displayed before purchase.
- **Coin-Based Payment System**: Accepts $10, $5, and $1 coins. Calculates total payment and returns change.
- **Resource Management**: Tracks water, milk, coffee, and cocoa levels after each transaction.
- **Daily Report & Shutdown**: Displays total earnings and remaining resources. Includes an “off” command to terminate the program.
